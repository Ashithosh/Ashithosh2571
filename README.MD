# Computer Studies (basic course) e-diary
What I learn from this course 
1- **mkdir** - its make to Create new Directories
2- **cd** - change the Directories
3- **pwd** - is where ami
4- **ls** - is list
5- **touch** - it is the easiest way to create new, empty files. It is also used to change the timestamps
6- **./** - hear
7- **cat** - cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal
8- **gcc** - is compiler
9- **echo** - This is a built in command that is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.
10- **echo PATH** - is the list of directories that will be searched for anything that you type on the command line. If you type in a built-in command like ls, it will look for a specified list of directories. You can look up your path by typing echo $PATH
11- **nano** - GNU nano is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface. It emulates the Pico text editor, part of the Pine email client, and also provides additional functionality
12- **$() in bash** - The dollar sign before the thing in parenthesis usually refers to a variable. This means that this command is either passing an argument to that variable from a bash script or is getting the value of that variable for something.
13- **bash** - That means, when you open the Bash shell in Windows, you are literally running Ubuntu so you can apt-get install any command-line application that's available for Ubuntu. As a result, every single Ubuntu command-line application is now available at your disposal.
